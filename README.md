# Advent of Code (2015-2023)
Solutions in several languages to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) problems.

This repository is inspired by [Dávid Németh](https://github.com/encse/adventofcode).

I am going to expand on it with each language I am learning or currently interested in outside of my bachelor studies.

Attention: It is more of a playground rather than a guide.
